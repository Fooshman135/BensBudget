# Ben's Budget Program
This program was written and designed entirely by Ben Katz. It was created as
a personal project, to showcase knowledge of Python (with some SQL thrown in).

This program is a command line based, personal finance budgeting app. It is a
work-in-progress, but its current development stage is sufficient for
demonstration purposes.

It is designed to be executed by a Python 3.6 interpreter (although earlier
versions of Python 3.x might work too) on Mac OS X Sierra. It has not been tested on
other operating systems.

This program will create directories and save files at the following location
(and nowhere else):

    ~/Library/Application Support/Ben's Budget Program

Please note that the program will exit if it comes across any operating system
errors or file system errors.

Thank you for your consideration.
