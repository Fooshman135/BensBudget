# Ben's Budget Program
This program was written and designed entirely by Ben Katz. It was created as a personal project, to showcase knowledge of Python (with some SQL thrown in).

This program is a command line based, personal finance budgeting app. It is a work-in-progress, but its current development stage is sufficient for demonstration purposes.

It is designed to be executed by a Python 3.6 or 2.7 interpreter on Mac OS X. It may work with other versions of Python but it has not been tested with them. It has not been tested on other operating systems.

This program has no dependencies, and should work out-of-the-box when this repo is cloned.

This program will create directories and save files at the following location (and nowhere else):

    ~/Library/Application Support/Ben's Budget Program

Please note that the program will exit if it comes across any operating system errors or file system errors.
